# Training configurations

Training recipes are organized under `backbones/<backbone>/<time_injection>/`.
Choose `tau_token` or `tau_AdaRMS`, then select the YAML for the task, flow
objective, camera setup and batch size. The shared `dataset_config`,
`observation_config`, `policy_config`, `robot_config` and `inference` groups
remain at this level because multiple backbones use them.

For example:

```bash
scripts/train/train.sh configs/100hzs1_train/backbones/efficientvit_b2/tau_AdaRMS/100hzs1_beat_block_hammer_efficientvit_b2_native_meanflow_adarms_3v_8gpu_L4.yaml
```

The original YAML paths remain as compatibility aliases, so existing launch
commands and external scripts continue to work. Edit the corresponding recipe
under `backbones/` rather than its alias. Moving a recipe does not change its
training settings or checkpoint output path.
